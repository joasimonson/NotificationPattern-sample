# Notification Pattern

The **Notification Pattern** allows an application to accumulate and return multiple validation errors and warnings, enabling more comprehensive error reporting without immediately halting execution if necessary.
It distinguishes between different levels of notifications, such as errors and warnings, ensuring both are handled appropriately.

# Result Pattern

The **Result Pattern** is used to encapsulate the outcome of an operation, including both success and failure states.
It typically involves returning a result object that contains information about the operation's success or failure, error messages, and any additional data.
This pattern helps in managing and communicating the results of operations in a clear and consistent manner.
